### Introduction
Ameliorate is an upcoming Minecraft Bedrock Add-on that aims to expand and improve existing features. Featuring new decorative and useful blocks, updated mob behavior, and quality of life improvements. 

### Background
Ameliorate is the first part of a big project consisting of three add-ons under the name of "Thea's Life". Building on this foundation, Ameliorate acts as a stepping stone for me to develop the principles and skills of game development for future projects within and beyond Minecraft. It started out as one aspect of one of the Add-ons but eventually culminated in its own project prioritizing updating the base game first, the point of reference being my survival world. 

### Planned Trilogy
1. 🔧 Ameliorate - Updating vanilla to fit the standards of the two add-ons, bridging the gaps of custom and vanilla features.
2. 🌏 Brave New World - Overworld update that comes with overhauled biomes, ecotones, diverse menagerie of mobs, and world building. (Where Ameliorate sprouted from)
3. 🔥 Nether Add-on - Nether update and yet to attain a name. An expansion to Piglin culture and the fiery world they live in with a slew of creepy crawlies. 
Add-ons after Ameliorate are subject to change. In a nutshell I am making Minecraft accustomed to my taste (eating your own dog food if you will) that I want to share with the community.

### Special Thanks
